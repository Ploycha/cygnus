                        We designed this wallet with two major goals.
                        It had to be simple enough so even your parents could
                        use it and it had to provide enough security for the
                        user so the funds could not be easily extracted by a
                        malicious party.

                        This is a first "social" wallet with fully integrated
                        contact book equipped with cryptographic signatures.
                        This provides allows for each user to have their own
                        unique payment address and ensures that the payment
                        address is really the address of the person who claims
                        it. With just a click of a button you can add your
                        destination contact and send them money.
                        
                        Your funds are always safe as you sign all your
                        transactions with the hardware key ring, which keeps
                        your keys securely.
